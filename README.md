An AI agent that scans Solidity contracts for [Uniswap Continuous Clearing Auction](https://github.com/Uniswap/continuous-clearing-auction) vulnerabilities. Finds bugs in CCA forks, protocols built on CCA, and unsafe auction deployments.

**Works with:** Claude Code · Cursor · Windsurf · GitHub Copilot

## What it does

Runs two parallel analysis agents against your Solidity codebase:

| Agent | Strategy | What it catches |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Vector Scan** | Systematic triage of 15 known CCA vulnerability patterns | Known footguns — fast, cheap, high recall |
| **Adversarial Reasoning** | Free-form adversarial bug hunting | Novel bugs, logic errors, economic exploits the vector list doesn't cover |

Results are deduplicated, scored by confidence, and presented as a single report.

### Vulnerability coverage

**Core vectors** (bugs in CCA's own code — relevant for forks):

| ID | Name | Severity |
|----|------|----------|
| VC1 | Tick iteration gas exhaustion (DoS) | High |
| VC2 | Pro-rata MEV at clearing tick | High |
| VC3 | Step schedule tail manipulation | High |
| VC4 | Direct transfer fund loss | Medium |
| VC5 | Q96 overflow at extreme supply/price | Medium |
| VC6 | Low-decimal / fee-on-transfer silent misallocation | Medium |
| VC7 | Permissionless claim zeroing | Critical (integration impact) |
| VC8 | v1.0.0 bid locking bug | Critical (if applicable) |
| VC9 | TSTORE poison (solc 0.8.28–0.8.33 via-ir) | Critical (if applicable) |

**Integration vectors** (bugs in code that calls into CCA):

| ID | Name | Severity |
|----|------|----------|
| VI1 | Stale tokensFilled read after claim | Critical |
| VI2 | Unsafe auction parameter deployment | High |
| VI3 | Direct currency/token transfer to CCA | Medium |
| VI4 | Fill amount stability assumption | High |
| VI5 | Parameter honeypot exposure | High |
| VI6 | v1.0.0 factory version mismatch | Critical (if applicable) |

The scanner auto-detects whether it's looking at CCA core code, integration code, or both — all applicable vectors fire.

## Requirements

- One of: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), or [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- Solidity source files in the target directory

## Installation

### Claude Code (recommended — dual-agent parallel scan)

```bash
# Option 1: curl into your project
mkdir -p .claude/commands
curl -o .claude/commands/scan-cca.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/33Audits/cca-audit-agent/main/.claude/commands/scan-cca.md

# Option 2: clone and point at your code
git clone https://github.com/33Audits/cca-audit-agent.git
cd cca-audit-agent
claude
# Then: /scan-cca /path/to/your/solidity/project
```

### Cursor

```bash
# Copy the rule file into your project
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
curl -o .cursor/rules/scan-cca.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/33Audits/cca-audit-agent/main/.cursor/rules/scan-cca.mdc
```

Then ask Cursor: *"Scan for CCA vulnerabilities"* or *"Run CCA audit"*

### Windsurf

```bash
# Copy the rules file to your project root
curl -o .windsurfrules \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/33Audits/cca-audit-agent/main/.windsurfrules
```

Then ask Windsurf: *"Scan for CCA vulnerabilities"* or *"Run CCA audit"*

### GitHub Copilot

```bash
# Copy the instructions file into your project
mkdir -p .github
curl -o .github/copilot-instructions.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/33Audits/cca-audit-agent/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Then ask Copilot: *"Scan for CCA vulnerabilities"* or *"Run CCA audit"*

## Usage

### Claude Code (slash command)

```
/scan-cca                              # scan current directory
/scan-cca ./contracts                  # scan specific directory
/scan-cca /path/to/protocol/src        # scan absolute path
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / Copilot (natural language)

Ask your agent:
- *"Scan this codebase for CCA vulnerabilities"*
- *"Run a CCA security audit on the contracts in src/"*
- *"Check these contracts for Uniswap CCA integration bugs"*

### Platform differences

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor / Windsurf / Copilot |
|---------|------------|----------------------------|
| Architecture | Dual-agent parallel (vector scan + adversarial) | Single-agent sequential |
| Speed | Both passes run simultaneously | One pass at a time |
| Depth | Two different cognitive strategies catch more bugs | Same vectors, single strategy |
| Token usage | ~50-80k across both agents | ~30-50k single agent |
| Invocation | `/scan-cca` slash command | Natural language prompt |

Claude Code gets the best results because it runs two agents with different analysis strategies in parallel. Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot run the same vectors but as a single sequential pass.

### What happens when you run it

1. **Prepare** — Finds all `.sol` files (excludes `test/`, `script/`, `lib/`), concatenates them into a temporary bundle
2. **Double pass** — Launches both agents in parallel:
   - Vector Scan agent reads the bundle, triages all 15 vectors, drops irrelevant ones in 1 line each, deep-analyzes survivors
   - Adversarial Reasoning agent reads all files, maps the CCA interaction surface, reasons adversarially about every call and state read
3. **Merge** — Deduplicates findings, re-numbers, sorts by confidence, presents the report

### Example output

```
📋 CCA Scan Report
Files scanned: 12
Lines analyzed: 3,847
Findings: 3 (1 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium)

🔴 **1. Stale tokensFilled read enables griefing bot to zero all user allocations**
src/VestingDistributor.sol:142-158 · Confidence: 92

**Description:** VestingDistributor.claimAllocation() reads bid.tokensFilled from CCA
after claimBlock without caching, allowing a front-runner to call claimTokens() first
and zero every user's vesting amount.

**Attack path:**
1. Wait for claimBlock
2. Call CCA.claimTokens(bidId) for all active bidIds (permissionless)
3. VestingDistributor.claimAllocation() now reads tokensFilled = 0 for every user
4. All vesting amounts compute to zero — funds permanently stuck

**Fix:**
\`\`\`diff
- uint256 filled = auction.getBid(bidId).tokensFilled;
+ uint256 filled = cachedFills[bidId]; // cached before claimBlock in snapshot()
\`\`\`

...
```

## How it stays token-efficient

- **Bundle read**: All source is concatenated into one file — agents read it in parallel chunks on turn 1, no repeated file I/O
- **Fast triage**: 15 vectors are classified in a single pass using grep signatures. Irrelevant vectors are dropped in 1 structured line each
- **FP gate**: Every potential finding must pass 3 checks (concrete path, reachable, impactful) before expansion. Kills false positives before they waste tokens
- **Hard stop**: Agents do not revisit eliminated vectors or re-scan

Typical scan of a ~3k line codebase uses ~50-80k tokens total across both agents.

## FP Gate

Every finding must pass all three checks or it's dropped:

1. **Concrete attack path** — Can you trace specific transactions from entry point to harm? (Name the functions.)
2. **Reachable** — Is the path actually reachable past all modifiers, requires, and access control?
3. **Impact** — Does the attacker profit or do users lose funds? Pure inconvenience without fund risk is dropped.

## Customization

The skill file at `.claude/commands/scan-cca.md` is self-contained. You can:

- **Add vectors**: Add new entries to the `CCA Vulnerability Vectors` section following the existing format (ID, grep signatures, description, confirm-if criteria)
- **Adjust severity**: Change the severity classification in the vector definitions
- **Change model**: The agents default to `sonnet` for cost/capability balance. Change to `opus` in the workflow section for maximum depth (costs more)
- **Modify scope**: Edit the exclusion list in the Scope section to include/exclude directories
